# repl.it-color

> Note: Replit now [supports custom themes](https://replit.com/themes) within the app itself, so this plugin is hereby deprecated :)
 
Allows customisation of the [repl.it](https://repl.it) color scheme (syntax highlighting).

To install, download the repository and extract it. Go to the [chrome extensions page](chrome://extensions) and enable `Developer Mode`, then click `Load Unpacked` and select the extracted repository. Change settings by clicking on the logo in the extensions bar and then clicking `options` in the drop down menu.

Make sure dark theme is enabled in repl.it.
